# 🔍 Project Description

# 🚀 Objective

The main objective of this project was to detect fraudulent transactions using a machine learning model. Fraudulent transactions can cause significant financial losses, and detecting them accurately is crucial for financial institutions.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used for this project included various features of financial transactions. Key attributes included:

Transaction Amount 💵
+ Transaction Date 📅
+ Transaction Location 📍
+ Account Information 🏦
+ Transaction Type 🔄
+ and more
  
# ⚠️ Challenge: Data Imbalance

One of the primary challenges encountered was data imbalance. In fraud detection, fraudulent transactions are much rarer compared to legitimate ones. This imbalance can lead to a model that is biased towards predicting non-fraudulent transactions, reducing its effectiveness in detecting fraud.

# ⚙️ Solution: Undersampling

To address the data imbalance issue, we employed undersampling techniques. Here's how it was implemented:

Identify Majority and Minority Classes: The dataset was split into fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
Undersample Majority Class: The number of non-fraudulent transactions was reduced to match the number of fraudulent transactions, creating a balanced dataset.

## Model Training: The balanced dataset was used to train various machine learning models.

## 🏗️ Methodology

+ Data Preprocessing:
+ Cleaning: Handled missing values and outliers.
+ Feature Engineering: Created new features to enhance model performance.
+ Normalization: Scaled numerical features for consistent model input.
+ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
+ Visualization: Created histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to understand data distributions and relationships.
+ Model Building:
+ Algorithms: Tested various algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
+ Evaluation Metrics: Used metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.

# Model Evaluation:

+ Cross-Validation: Performed cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
+ Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model parameters to improve accuracy.

# Results:

Achieved a balanced model performance with significant improvement in detecting fraudulent transactions compared to the baseline model.
